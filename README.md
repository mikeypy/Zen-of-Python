# Zen-of-Python
A Simple Script that displays the Zen-of-Python after some few input(prompt)

Hi Humans

I do consider myself a lil bit of a pythonista. Of course not like the man himself 'Guido van Rossum' but....I just really love the language. Also the philosophy from Tim himself the Zen of Python keeps me munching on python's functions and modules. AWESOME!!!!

Anyway this Script was me teaching my son the lovely part of programming, well... let's just say he really just wanted to watch Captain America-Civil War.
